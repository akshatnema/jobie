The following is a set of guidelines to help you begin your contribution to the JobIE. If you want to propose any change to this document feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

<h1>How to Contribute</h1>

<h2>Raise an Issue</h2>
<p>Did you find something which can be improved further ?? Feel free to share it <a href="https://github.com/akshatnema/jobie/issues"> here</a>.</p>

<p>Pull requests are the way concrete changes are made to the code, documentation dependencies, and tools contained in the JobIE repository.</p>
<h2>Setting up your local environment</h2>
<h3>Step 1:Fork</h3>
<p>Fork the project on Github and clone your fork locally to your system.</p>
<p><b>Using SSH:</b></p>
    
```console
    $  git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/jobie.git
```
<i>OR</i>
<p><b>Using HTTPS:</b></p>

```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/jobie.git
```
<p>Then navigate to JobIE</p>

```console
    $ cd jobie  
```
<h3>Step 2:Branch</h3>
To keep your development environment organized, create local branches to hold your work. These should be branched directly off of the main branch.

```console
   $ git checkout -b my-branch -t upstream/main
   $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/akshatnema/jobie.git
   $ git fetch upstream
```
<h3>Step 3:Build</h3>
<p>Now we are ready to build the project , but first of all make sure that you have <b>NodeJS</b> installed in your system.<p>
    
 <p>Inside the jobie folder run the following commands to install all the dependencies.<p>
     
```console
    $ cd server
    $ npm install
``` 
(To install all the server side dependencies)
<p>Similarly for the front-end side, use the following commands in the jobie folder<p>
     
```console
    $ cd web
    $ npm install
```
<h3>Step 4:Setting up development variables</h3>
Now we need to create a .env file which will contain our development variables such as Atlas string(URI) and Twitter Bearer Token for the twitter API.

```console
    $ cd server
    $ touch .env
    $ nano .env
```
<p>Note:You can use any text editor in place of nano.</p>

<p>Now inside the .env file use your development variables as shown below.</p>

```console
    ATLAS_URI="mongodb+srv://user_name:password@cluster0.bscef8f.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
    TWITTER_API="AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANAUSgEAAAAA%2BwvPQqv%xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxdCH93sdrzv"
```

<p><b>Twitter Bearer Token</b>: Click <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-portal">here.</a></p>
<p><b>ATLAS URI</b>: Click <a href="https://account.mongodb.com/account/login?n=%2Fv2%2F62f7e246576e344fad111a1c&nextHash=%23clusters">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Step 5:Start Developing</h3>
<p>For all the users working on the frontend. You can make changes and load JobiE locally by running the following inside the web directory.</p>

```console
   $ npm start
```
<p>Similarly for the server side, use the same command inside the sever directory.</p>
Your site will be hosted locally at: <b>http://localhost:8000/</b>

<h3>Step 6:Commit</h3>
<p>It is recommended to keep your changes grouped logically within individual commits. Commits are a great way to help your fellow contributors keep check of the changes you made to the project.</p>

```console
   $ git add my/changed/file
   $ git commit -m "changes-made"
```

<h2>Push</h2>
<p>Once your commits are ready to go begin the process of opening a pull request by pushing your working branch to your fork on GitHub.</p>

```console
   $ git push origin my-branch
```
